Pre-interview tasks for prospective PHP developers.

## A: HTML and CSS

Implement [assignments/a/profile.jpg](assignments/a/designs/profile.jpg). 

Make a responsive grid containing a few of these profiles 
(max 3 per line) for different people (use random names, and any pictures). Buttons do not have to lead anywhere.
Pay special attention to positioning and coloring.

## B: PHP

### 1: Object-Oriented Design

Explain in no more than one page (A4) how you would design the classes and database of a private messaging system on a website. Feel free to include model diagrams.

### 2: HTTP Requesting Command-line Tool

Write a command-line PHP program that accepts one argument that should be a valid URL. The program should send a request to the given
URL, parse the response and save the response time and status code as JSON in a file.

Pretend that you are working in a team, and that this component will be a part in a larger application; pay attention to how you choose to structure your application. Feel free to use any external libraries.
