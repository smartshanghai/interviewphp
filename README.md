Pre-interview tasks for prospective PHP developers.

## A: HTML and CSS

### Task

Implement [assignments/a/profile.jpg](assignments/a/designs/profile.jpg). Make a responsive grid containing a couple of these profiles 
(max 3 per line) for different people (use random names, and any pictures). Buttons do not have to lead anywhere. 
Pay attention to positioning and coloring.

## B: PHP

### 1: Object-Oriented Design

Explain in no more than one page (A4) how you would design the classes and database of a private messaging system on a website. Feel free to include model diagrams.

### 2: HTTP Requesting Command-line Tool

Write a command-line PHP program that accepts one argument that should be a valid URL. The program should send a request to the given
URL and parse the response and save some interesting information about the response as JSON in a text file.

Feel free to use any helpful libraries from Composer to achieve the goal.
